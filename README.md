# Text-Clusterting
There are various algo avaiable for clustering as below.
1.K_means
2.DBSCAN
3.GAussianMixture
4.Agglomerative
5.WARD 
 
I have used Kmeans for text clustering on sample data.
We can use varius word embeddings like word2vec,Glove,Fasttext and even TFIDF to convert the text into vectors.

I have tried Kmeans on TFIDF,Word2vec and on Fasttext.

Best results are provided by fasttext and TFIDF even.

I tried on word vectors as well as sent vectors.

code is available in Kmeans_Clustering.py
